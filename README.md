Sparky - Flight Controller Variants for Arduino_Core_STM32

This repo contains the documentation for Sparky Flight Controller variants to be used as part of Arduino_Core_STM32.

The Sparky line of flight controllers was created by TauLabs https://github.com/TauLabs/TauLabs, originally in support of the now defunct OpenPilot project.  The Sparky controllers were ST ARM Cortex STM32F303CC (Sparky V1) and STM32F405RG (Sparky V2) based designs with integrated IMU, pressure sensor and CAN bus connections.  They are fairly well documented on TuaLabs GitHub at https://github.com/TauLabs/TauLabs/wiki/Sparky.
